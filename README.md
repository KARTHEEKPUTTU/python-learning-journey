# Python Basics - Grade Calculator

This is one of my first Python practice projects.  
I wrote a small console program that calculates grades based on marks for 5 subjects.

### What it does
- Asks for marks in 5 subjects (each between 0 and 100).
- If I enter something invalid (like 120), it asks me again until I give a valid mark.
- After all marks are entered, it shows:
  - Total percentage
  - Grade (A, A-, B, C, D, or F)

### Example
Enter marks for subject_1 (0-100): 90
Enter marks for subject_2 (0-100): 80
Enter marks for subject_3 (0-100): 75
Enter marks for subject_4 (0-100): 95
Enter marks for subject_5 (0-100): 85

You got 85.00% which leads to "A-" grade

### Why I made this
Iâ€™m re-learning Python from scratch.  
This project helped me practice:
- Taking input
- Using loops
- Simple validation
- If/else statements

Itâ€™s a small step in my **Python learning journey** ðŸš€
